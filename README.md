## Features

### Set your own writing goals (and reach them)

Writing a novel for the first time often appears as a overwhelming task. That is why many authors sit at their desk everyday to deliver a small amount of words, hence completing their work through a consistent process. inkip.it focuses on data to give you an accurate overview of your writing process. By counting the consecutive days dedicated to writing your novel, it encourages you to write a little bit every day thus creating your own routine.

### Design your own universe

Character design might be one of the main barrier when it comes to writing a fiction for the first time. inkip.it guides you through world building by implementing characters sheets (physical appearance, psychological traits, relationships with other characters, etc.)

### Share your work with the community

Working on your own can be challenging, especially when you are looking for feedbacks. inkip.it lets you share your chapters with the community of other writers that face the same writing challenge you face everyday.
